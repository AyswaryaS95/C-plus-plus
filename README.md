<h4>Overview</h4>
Given two numbers N and M .N indicates the number of elements in the array A[](1-indexed) and M
indicates number of queries. You need to perform two types of queries on the array .
<li>You are given M queries. Queries can be of two types, type 1 and type 2.</li>
<li>Type 1 queries are represented as 1 i j : Modify the given array by removing elements from i to j
and adding them to the front.</li>
<li>Type 2 queries are represented as 2 i j : Modify the given array by removing elements from i to j
and adding them to the back.</li>
<li>Your task is to simply print |A[1] - A[N]| of the resulting array after the execution of M queries followed
by the resulting array.</li>
<h5>Note: While adding at back or front the order of elements is preserved</h5>
